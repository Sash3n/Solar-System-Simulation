# 3D Solar System Simulator

This is a simple 3D Solar System Simulator built using HTML and JavaScript. It renders the Sun, planets of the solar system, and some of their moons in a 3D space environment.

## How to Use

To use the simulator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebGL.

## Video to view 

To view how the 3D Solar System Simulation, please see the video recorded within the folder.

## Features

- 3D rendering of the Sun, planets, and some moons of the solar system.
- Click on any celestial object to zoom in on it.
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Three.js library for 3D rendering

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the simulator.
- `3DSolarSystem.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for rendering the solar system.

## How it Works

The simulator uses Three.js library to create a 3D scene with various celestial objects representing the Sun, planets, and moons. Each object is positioned relative to its orbit around the Sun and rotates accordingly.

## Credits

Textures for the celestial objects were obtained from various sources and are credited in the JavaScript file.
